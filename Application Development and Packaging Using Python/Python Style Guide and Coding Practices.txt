Python Conventions:
    - PEP8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8)
        - Using spaces for indentation (rather than tabs as these differ between IDEs)
        - Guideline is to use four spaces for indentation.
        - Use blank lines to separate functions and classes.
        - Use spaces around operators and commas.
        - Using functions for blocks of codes.
        - Naming convention wiht lowercase with underscores (snake_case).
        - for packages however, do not use underscores.
        - CamelCase used for classes (helps distinguish them with functions).
        - For constants, capitalize all words and separate the words with underscores, e.g. MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE as opposed to max_file_upload_size.

    - Static code analysis
        - Commonly used to manage compliance.
        - Evaluates style compliance wihtout executing the code.
        - find issus such as:
            - Programming errors.
            - Coding standard violations.
            - Undefined vlaues
            - syntax violations
            - Security vulnerabilities.
        - Use PyLint to check the Python code compliance with PEP8 guidelines.
