Application Development and Packaging Using Python


1. Application development lifecycle phases
    i. Requirement Gathering Phase - 
        - user requirements
        - business requirements 
        - technical requirements 
        - note constraints.
    ii. Analysis and design phases
        - Once the Requirements are in -> Analyse, Verify, Revise -> Design, Verify, Revise -> Design Document.
    iii. Code and test phases
        - Design Document -> Coding -> Testing <-> Revise -> Tested Programs (meeting documented requirements).
        Types of Testing:
            a. Perform Unit Testing
            b. User Testing
            c. Performance
            d. Integration tests
            e. Validate test results.
            --> Final Tested Programs.
    iv. Production Phase
        - Final Tested Programs --> Promote to Production --> Production Repository
    v. Maintenance Phase
        - Upgrade
        - Add Features

    
    Best Practices:
        i. Maintain Mupltiple files
            - Requiremetns for functionalities vary
            - code each functionality in a separate file
                - makes code maintenance efficient and easy. 
                - helps when new functionality is added.
