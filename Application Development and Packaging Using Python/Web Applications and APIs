What is a web app?
    - Stored on a remote server
    - Delivered over the internet.
    Three components:
    1. Web server.
    2. App server
    3. Database

    Common programming Languages:
        Front-end:
            - JavaScript
            - HTML
            - CSS
        Back-end:
            - Python
            - Java
            - Ruby

Advantages of web apps (over local apps)
    - Version uniformity (same version is available to mulitple users at the same time)
    - Hardware platform flexibility
    - Web browser Flexibility
    - No local installation

What is an API?
    - Software componenet that enables apps to communicate
    - Featuers
        - Increased Flexibility
        - Standardized rules and functions

    API example:
    - Weather App 
        App requests information through a Weather API.
        The API gets data from the weather data store.
        The app then works on that data to forecast the weather.
    

API Architectures
    1. Representation State transfer (REST)
    2. Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)

Advantages of APIs
    - Increased connectivity
    - Supports CRUD actions.
    - Works with PUT, POST, DELETE, and GET.
    - Customizable

APIs vs web apps
    Web Apps
    Form of API that communicates between the front and back end.
        - Share Data with other apps.
        - All Web Apps are APIs
    API
        Generic term given to apps that create a link between two parts of a system.
        - Includes both "online" or web-based and "offline" apps.
